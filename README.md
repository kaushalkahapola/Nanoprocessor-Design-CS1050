# Nanoprocessor Design Competition

## Overview
Nanoprocessor Design Competition is a collaborative project undertaken by [Your Team Name] for the CS1050 Computer Organization and Digital Design course at the University of Moratuwa.

## Project Description
The project involves the design and development of a 4-bit processor capable of executing 4 instructions. The goal is to create a simple microprocessor (nanoprocessor) with various components like a 4-bit Add/Subtract unit, a 3-bit adder, a 3-bit Program Counter, k-way b-bit multiplexers, a Register Bank, Program ROM, and an Instruction Decoder.

## Features
- 4-bit Arithmetic Unit
- 3-bit Adder
- 3-bit Program Counter
- k-way b-bit Multiplexers
- Register Bank
- Program ROM
- Instruction Decoder

## Build and Test
1. **Design and Test Individual Components:**
   - Follow the steps outlined in the lab manual to design and test each component.
   - Collaborate with team members to ensure each component functions correctly.

2. **Connect Components for Top-Level Design:**
   - Integrate individual components to form the top-level design of the nanoprocessor.

## Run Simulation
- Use simulation tools to verify the functionality of the nanoprocessor.
- Ensure that each component interacts correctly within the overall design.

## Upload to the Development Board
- Implement the design on the BASYS 3 development board.
- Follow hardware-specific guidelines for uploading the nanoprocessor design.
